                Look at me<br>
                I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree<br>
                And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
                I can't understand<br>
                I get misty, just holding your hand<br>

                Walk my way<br>
                And a thousand violins begin to play<br>
                Or it might be the sound of your hello<br>
                That music I hear<br>
                I get misty whenever you're near

                Don't you know that you're leading me on?<br>
                And it's just what I want you to do<br>
                Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?<br>
                That's why I'm following you<br>

            <p class="lyrics">
                On my own<br>
                When I wander through this wonderland alone<br>
                Never knowing my right foot from my left<br>
                My hat from my glove<br>
                I'm too misty, and too much in love<br>
